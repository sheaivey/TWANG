# HTML Minify Tools
`make.js` will compress any html file found in `src/*` and output its contents to `dist/*`.
`dist/PROGMEM.h` contains all html files ready to be used in your program.

You will need `Node.JS` installed. Install the dependencies.
```
npm install
```

Make `dist/PROGMEM.h` by running the following command.
```
npm run make
```
